Please provide an automated solution which:

1. Creates EC2 instance in AWS
1. Starts Nginx server on that EC2 with "Hello world" html
1. Creates AWS EFS and mounts it to the above EC2 instance

You can implement either 1 + 2 or 1 + 3, it's up to you!

Instructions:

We suggest you to spend no more than 1 hour on the solution of this task and use any tools you think are most suitable here. Please also provide a short README file with instructions of how to use it. We will take your solution as a base for the next interview and will ask questions about it.
This challenge is aiming to get your understanding of cloud infrastructure and automation tools, not to measure how fast you can create a solution. If you want to spend more time on this, it's up to you. In general, one hour should be enough time
